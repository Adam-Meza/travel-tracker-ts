# Wander - "Travel Tracker" - TypeScript Travel Application 
Wander is a single page, vanilla TypeScipt application by [Adam Meza](adam-meza.com) as part of the cirriculum at Turing School for Software Designs' frontend program. The main goal of this assignment was to practice making API calls, creating a clean, readable UI and responding to events on the DOM. IT was completed over the course of 1 week in 2023 in Javascript and CSS. It was then refactored and converted to TS and SCSS in the summer of 2025. 

Deployment can be found [here](https://travel-tracker-ts-tjsq-mwcx4krtv-adammezas-projects.vercel.app/).
