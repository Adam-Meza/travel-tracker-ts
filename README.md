# Wander üåç‚úàÔ∏è

## Abstract

**Wander** ‚Äî an invitation to discover.  
This single-page travel planning web application lets users log in, explore their past and future trips, and plan new getaways. Built with **TypeScript, SCSS, and modern JavaScript tooling**, it features both a **Traveler View** and an **Agent Portal**:

- **Travelers** can log in, view trip details, estimate costs with dynamic form inputs, and request new trips.
- **Agents** have a dedicated dashboard to review pending requests, track profits, and visualize yearly earnings with interactive charts.

Wander was created by [Adam Meza](adam-meza.com) as part of the cirriculum at Turing School for Software Designs' frontend program. The main goal of this assignment was to practice making API calls, creating a clean, readable UI and responding to events on the DOM. IT was completed over the course of 1 week in 2023 in Javascript and CSS. It was then refactored and converted to TS and SCSS in the summer of 2025. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Adam-Meza/Travel-Tracker).

_Deployment can be found [here](https://travel-tracker-ts-tjsq-mwcx4krtv-adammezas-projects.vercel.app/)._
